Bugs: 
	1. When adding an exercise, if the user attempts to add the exercise that is initially generated on loading w/o first selecting 
	   it, it will not capture the name when the exercise is saved. 

To do: 
	1. Allow users to add more than one exercise at once. 
	2. Allow users to view the description for an exercise they have already added. 
	3. Allow users to change their username and email. 
	4. Allow users to change the name of an workout.
	5. Allow users to change the reps and sets of an exercise.
